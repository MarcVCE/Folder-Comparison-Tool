Folder Comparison Tool
-----------------------

This script compares two folders (including all their subfolders) by file *name + extension*.
It shows which files are present in one folder but missing in the other.

üí° Typical use case:
When you copy a large number of files from one folder to another (sometimes multiple times),
it is easy to miss some files or end up with extra ones.  
This tool helps you quickly identify:
 - Files that exist in Folder A but not in Folder B
 - Files that exist in Folder B but not in Folder A

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
It only compares by file name + extension, not by content.
